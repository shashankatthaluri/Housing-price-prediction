# Housing-price-prediction
We are took data from the California census to build a machine learning model that will estimate house prices in the State
For each block group in California, the data contains elements like population, median income, and median home values
our machine learning model ought to be able to learn from this data and estimate the median house price in any neighbourhood
We predicted prices based on the locations by an assumption saying the land near the ocean tend to be higher price and model is developed
Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor is performed on train data and compare with test data
