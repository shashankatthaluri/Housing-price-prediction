# Housing Price Prediction 🏡💰🤖

Welcome to the **Housing Price Prediction** repository! 🌟📈

## Overview 📝

This project leverages data from the California census to construct a robust machine learning model aimed at estimating house prices in the state. With features such as population, median income, and median home values for each block group in California, our machine learning model is designed to learn from this data and provide accurate estimates of median house prices in any neighborhood.

## Key Features 🚀

- **California Census Data:** The dataset is sourced from the California census, encompassing crucial elements like population, median income, and median home values.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Our machine learning model employs both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor algorithms to predict house prices based on location. The model is trained on a set of data and validated against a separate test dataset.

## How It Works 🤖🏠

1. **Data Collection:** California census data is gathered, containing information about various block groups, including population, median income, and median home values.

2. **Model Training:** The machine learning model is trained using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor algorithms. It learns to make predictions based on the provided features.

3. **Prediction:** The trained model is then capable of estimating median house prices in any neighborhood, making predictions based on input features. The assumption that proximity to the ocean influences housing prices is factored into the predictions.

## Model Evaluation 📊🔍

The model's performance is evaluated using both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor on training data, and the results are compared with the test dataset.

## Contributing 🤝💡
